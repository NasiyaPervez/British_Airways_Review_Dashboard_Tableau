**Conclusion:**

After completion, the dashboard offers a thorough analysis of British Airways' performance by displaying important indicators including the average scores for various aircraft groups' value for money, entertainment, food, ground service, and cabin service. By letting analyzers work with several filters—like date, passenger type, aircraft group, seat type, and continent—it provides a thorough analysis of the airline's level of customer service. British Airways can better understand service patterns and consumer feedback with the help of the dashboard, which presents the data in an easy-to-understand map and summary metrics. This helps the airline identify areas for development and make well-informed decisions to improve overall customer satisfaction. For service-oriented businesses, such insights are key for overall improvement.
